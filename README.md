# SquirrelRobot
We present a small program using Jason, an interpreter for an extended version of AgentSpeak, a logic-based agent-oriented programming language.

The robot is a squirrel one which is designed to evolve quiet easily in a nuclear power plant, its main goal will be to take the state of the materials in its environment (the NPP) and inform the supervisor (humans) about it. To this end, it has sophisticated sensors to perceive its environment, acquire new beliefs, and then take actions.
